    "# The heart of Austin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to simulate the Heart Rate (HR) of ten citizens of Austin, TX. Our virtual study participants will be 10, 25-years old, individuals that sleep (8 hours a day), perform normal activites for the majority of the day (14 hours) and perform high-intensity exercise (2 hours a day). We will follow the participants over a period of one week, with measurements of their HR for every hour of the week.\n",

    "The dataset we will provide opportunities to practice working with Numpy Arrays and randn, plotting time series and scatter plots using matplotlib. \n",

    " - Advanced operations with Numpy Arrays\n",
    " - Advanced indexing into Numpy Arrays\n",
    " - Simulation of datasets assuming normally distributed data (randn)\n",
    " - computation of basic descriptiv statistics (mean, median and standard deviation)\n",

    "### Setting up the simulation and the variables needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulation will use some basic concepts from statistics that you might be familiar with (but it does not really matter if you are not!). HR is measured in Beats Per Minute (BPM). The HR of a population are somehow variable across individuals and generally normally distributed. This means that folks have a higher HR at rest, others a lower one, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will be the assumptions used for our simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Rest HR\n",
    "The mean rest HR of a population of 25-years old individuals is about `75` BPM. The variance across individuals (the between samples variance) is about `10` BMP. This means that whereas the majority of the individuals will have a HR of about `75` BPM, several will have one as low as `55` BPM and others as high as `95` BPM. We will assume that the Rest HR will be associated with the Sleep and Exercise HR. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Sleep HR\n",
    "We will assume that the mean HR during sleep goes down by about 20 BPM from the population mean of `75` BPM. That means that an average individual will have an HR of `55` BPM during sleep. More generally that reduction corresponds to about `70%` reduction in HR during sleep (`55/75=0.733`). \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Exercise HR\n",
    "We will use a commom computation an assume that max HR during a high-intensity exercise will be predicted as follows: `max HR = 220-Age`, that means that for our 25 years old Austinites the expected HR under high-intensity exercise is 195 BPM. That is about a `2.6` times higher than the base HR in the population. Sowe will use that number, `2.6` to do our calculations."

    "Remember, we are assuming a correlation between Rest HR, Sleep HR and Exercise HR. To simulate that, we can start by simulating ten individuals drawn randomly from the population of Austin with a Rest HR of 75 BPM. After that, we can simulate the Sleep HR as a modification of the distribution of Rest HR and similarly the Exercise HR as an increase of the distribution of Rest HR. In both cases, Sleep and Exercise HR will have their own variance added on top of the variance already existing in the group of ten Austinites. "

For example, if exercises start at 6 am and end at 8 am we will set up a variable (a numpy array) with `6` in the first slot and `8` in the second, e.g., `a_numpy_array[0]=6` and `a_numpy_array[1]=8`. \n",

Similarly, the indices for the third day are the indices for the second day plus `24`. So, in this case we identified a conveneient trick, an approach that allow us to populate the correct days from 1-7 by reating first arrays holding the correct indcies only for day 1 and then simply transofrming the indices for day one to day two, three, four, etc by adding 24, multiple times, sequentially.\n",
